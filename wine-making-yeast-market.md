<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wine-Making Yeast Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Yeast Extract</li><li>Autolyzed Yeast</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wine-making yeast market can be categorized into two main types: yeast extract and autolyzed yeast. Yeast extract is derived from the cell walls of yeast and is rich in amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, enhancing flavor and fermentation processes. Autolyzed yeast, on the other hand, results from the self-digestion of yeast cells after fermentation, producing a concentrated source of nutrients and flavor enhancers. Both types play crucial roles in improving wine quality and complementing various wine styles.</p></p>
