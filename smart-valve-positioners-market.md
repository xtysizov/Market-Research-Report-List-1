<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Valve Positioners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting Positioners</li><li>Double Acting Positioners</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Smart Valve Positioners market is segmented into single acting and double acting positioners. Single acting positioners use a spring mechanism to return the valve to a default position when there's no control signal, providing simplicity and reliability for applications with limited control dynamics. In contrast, double acting positioners offer more precise control by using air pressure to move the valve both open and closed, making them ideal for applications requiring rapid response and enhanced accuracy in flow regulation.</p></p>
